This week was amazing. As a new comer in programming life I have to work hard master the principles variables, functions, classes and others.

I read the textbook and I made an intensive research on W3School to have a solid understanding of programming.

I got an encouraging feedback from my peers which gives me more energy to keep moving.

I was surprised by the way computer iterates programs and responds to codes in a very short time. I also wonder what programming language are programming languages made in.

This week has shown me that programming requires higher discipline to keep moving and keep learning as well since technology is not static hence dynamic.

I mastered well for loops and while loops and I am looking forward to gaining more stuffs to have enough package to build my own software hence programming language or an operating system, why not?

Nothing that excites me than writing a code and running it smoothly but the more one is to resolve a bug in your program.
